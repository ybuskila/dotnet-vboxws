# dotNet wrapper for the webservice API of VirtualBox #
dotnet-vboxws is a set of easy-to-use classes that allow you to use the webservice client API of Sun xVM VirtualBox in an object-oriented manner from any dotNet language.

Originally developed in [abiquo](http://www.abiquo.com) for a side project. Currently does not cover the entire VirtualBox API.
